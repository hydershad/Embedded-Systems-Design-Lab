// software and trigger a conversion, wait for it to finish,

// There are many choices to make when using the ADC, and many
// different combinations of settings will all do basically the
// same thing.  For simplicity, this function makes some choices
// for you.  When calling this function, be sure that it does
// not conflict with any other software that may be running on
// the microcontroller.  Particularly, ADC0 sample sequencer 3
// is used here because it only takes one sample, and only one
// sample is absolutely needed.  Sample sequencer 3 generates a
// raw interrupt when the conversion is complete, but it is not
// promoted to a controller interrupt.  Software triggers the
// ADC0 conversion and waits for the conversion to finish.  If
// somewhat precise periodic measurements are required, the
// software trigger can occur in a periodic interrupt.  This
// approach has the advantage of being simple.  However, it does
// not guarantee real-time.
//
// This initialization function sets up the ADC according to the
// following parameters.  Any parameters not explicitly listed
// below are not modified:
// Max sample rate: <=125,000 samples/second
// Sequencer 0 priority: 1st (highest)
// Sequencer 1 priority: 2nd
// Sequencer 2 priority: 3rd
// Sequencer 3 priority: 4th (lowest)
// SS3 triggering event: software trigger
// SS3 1st sample source: Ain9 (PE4)
// SS3 interrupts: enabled but not promoted to controller
